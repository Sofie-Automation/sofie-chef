# Sofie Chef

This is a small Electron application which is used to display a number of web pages in fullscreen.

# Usage

When the application first starts, a `config.json`-file is created in the same folder as the executable.

When the `config.json`-file is edited, the application applies the changes instantly.

Most properties of the `config.json`-file are also automatically updated when moving or resizing the windows.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `Alt+CTRL+F` toggles fullscreen for the currently selected window

## Configuration
